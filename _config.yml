about: "I am a telecommunication engineer (Master level) with lots of projects in my head. I was born in Spain, but I'm currently living in Sweden, in Västeras. I have always shown interest about the technology, so it's very exciting to run this website with some of my current work. I hope I can share as many projects as possible. Oh, and if you like any project, you can always grab the code from GitHub. You can also email me if you have any suggestion, question, or any other reason."
