## Finally! Up and running!

This website is something I wanted to do long time ago. Since I learnt to program, I needed a platform to act as a diary of my projects. I have been building this website for a few months, working when I had some free time. That included time inside trains and buses, and many other places. Finally, I can say I'm proud to present the final website (although there are still tons of things to do). While this has required a lot of effort, research and hours in front of the computer, now I can say it has been totally worth it. The experience of building the website from its bones has been priceless. I will be updating the blog (and, of course, the entire website) whenever I can. I'm currently working on my Master Thesis, so the updates will come slow. I hope you investigate every part of the website, and you like it as much as I do. Thank you for coming!

## What to see

I really believe you should head first to the [Portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio) section. I have uploaded a couple of projects that you can check, although one is still in development, so I'll be updating it as soon as I can. Whenever I start a new project, I'll post here in the blog a small introduction about it. Then, if you are interested, you will find a link to the project, where you can read all the description, requirements, etc.

If you have any suggestion, questions, improvements and whatever you want about the projects or the website, you can leave me a message in [Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact). Of course, you can also use that section to contact me for whatever other reason you want (work, discussions or interesting information). I'm willing to talk to you!

Finally, if you want to know a bit more about me, you definetely should go to [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about). There you can find my CV, along with my story. You can get to know me a bit more in that section, and if you like what you see, you can always contact me!
