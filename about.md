## 2. Interests
-   **Reading:** It’s one of my favorite activities. As an avid reader, I really get interested when there is something new to learn. I consider myself a very curious person, and reading is one of the best ways to discover something.
-   **Piano:**I’ve been playing piano since I can remember, whenever I had time. I really enjoy the Piano. One of the most challenging instruments, people say, but on the other hand, you can make yourself shiver when you play it. I can also say I’m a big fan of the music in general.
-   **Sport:** My favorite one is skiing, but I also practice swimming, paddle tennis, basketball, hiking, running and mountain biking. 
-   **Technology:** I am a big fan of the technology. Whether it is about mobile OS, new electronic devices or network systems, I like to spend read news about technology. I have also done some projects by myself related with computer science, and network security.
-   **Drawing:** Despite I don’t consider myself a good drawer, I like to sit down, put some relaxing music, and start drawing a picture.
-   **Gardening:** Last but not least, I like the nature, and I enjoy taking care of a piece of it.
